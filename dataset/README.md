Table of Saturn magnetopause and bow shock crossings covering entire Cassini mission. It was built on top of the crossing list from Jackman et al. 2019 (doi: 10.1029/2019JA026628).

Introduction 
The labels in the list table are as follows:
Type:
MP: magnetopause
BS: bow shock
DG: data gap
SC: SCAS interval (unreliable data)
 
Direction:
I: in
O: out
S_SW start in the solar wind (for data gap or SCAS)
E_SW end in the solar wind (for data gap or SCAS)
S_SH start in the sheath (for data gap or SCAS)
E_SH end in the sheath (for data gap or SCAS)
S_SP start in the magnetosphere (for data gap or SCAS)
E_SP end in the magnetosphere (for data gap or SCAS)
